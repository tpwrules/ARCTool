CHANGELOG

v0.3b:
	Fixed a bug with RARC extraction where it would improperly detect . and .. entries and either skip directories or recurse infinitely. (Again, my test archives decieved me!)
	Added the -l option which lists the contents of the archive without extracting them.
	Can now be imported as a module.

v0.2b:
	Fixed a bug in the U8 support where it would not properly change directories. I know I said this was 100% working, but this bug wasn't triggered by the layout of my test archives.
	Now supports extracting multiple archives at once. Just specify them one after another on the command line.

v0.1b:
	Public release
